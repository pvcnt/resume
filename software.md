I had the opportunity to write or contribute to several pieces of software since I discovered programming.
I am committed to release the code as open source whenever possible.
You will find some examples of projects I contributed to on <a href="https://github.com/pvcnt">my GitHub page</a>.

<h2>Accio</h2>
Accio is the main software I wrote during my PhD thesis.
It is a framework enabling to study location privacy easily.
Even non-programmers are enabled to launch experiments and analyze their results through various interfaces.
Accio source code is available <a href="https://github.com/privamov/accio">on GitHub</a>, alongside with <a href="https://privamov.github.io/accio/">its documentation</a>.
