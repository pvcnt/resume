I had the opportunity to write or contribute to several pieces of software since I discovered programming.
I am committed to release the code as open source whenever possible.
You will find some examples of projects I contributed to on [my GitHub page](https://github.com/pvcnt).

## Accio
Accio is the main software I wrote during my PhD thesis.
It is a framework enabling to study location privacy easily.
Even non-programmers are enabled to launch experiments and analyse their results through various interfaces.
Accio source code is available [on GitHub](https://github.com/privamov/accio), alongside with [its documentation](https://privamov.github.io/accio/).

## Private Data Donor
Private Data Donor is a platform to crowd-source Web searches in a privacy-preserving way.
They allow researchers to then exploit this data, e.g., to predict the spread of infectious diseases.
It is formed of a server and a Chrome extension.
The source code is available [on GitHub](https://github.com/pddisense/pdd), while [the project's website](https://ppd.cs.ucl.ac.uk/) provides more information and documentation.
